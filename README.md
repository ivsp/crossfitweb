# WOD TARGET
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivsp/crossfitweb/main/src/assets/images/wodtarget.JPG)

## Description
Website to create and join crossfit events. This website has two different users. The first one, the sports centres, who create the events. The second, the athletes who sign up for these events.
It is a RESTFULL API. For the front-end I used React Bootstrap, for the back-end I used NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
The website has implemented a registration with email validation. You must be registered and logged in to enjoy all the features.
